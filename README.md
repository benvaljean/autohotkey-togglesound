# autohotkey-togglesound
Toggle 3 sound devices with autohotkey on Windows 7 or later with the press of the Scroll lock key

This autohotkey script toggles between 3 sound outputs without the use of any saved files to store the current output source. It has been tested only with Windows 7 but should work in a version later than 7 too.

The script can be fairly easy adapted to handle <>3 time sources - if you have have problems raise an issue or even better create a PR with your proposed change.

Originally adapted form the script found here: https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/68257-toggle-set-default-audio-device-in-windows-7/
